            <h1>Hey, I'm Muddabir</h1>
            <h3>I'm a design-minded, detail oriented software engineer passionate <br>
                about combining beautiful code with beautiful design.</h3>
            <span></span>
            <p> <strong><b>I'm a fourth year student at Northeastern University</b></strong> in Boston studying computer
                <br>
                science and interaction design. I have experience developing and designing software for <br>
                the web, from simple landing pages to progressive web applications. I strive to create <br>
                software that not only functions efficiently under the hood, but also provides intuitive, <br>
                pixel-perfect user experiences.
            </p>
            <p>I love learning new and better ways to create seamless user experiences with clean,<br>
                efficient, and scalable code. I consider work an ongoing education, and I'm always looking <br>
                for opportunities to work with those who are willing to share their knowledge as <br>
                much as I want to learn. At the end of the day, my primary goal is to create something beautiful <br>
                with people that bring out the best in me.</p>
            <p><strong><b>When I'm not in front of a computer screen,</b></strong>
                I'm probably snowboarding, traveling, <br>
                petting dogs, or learning a new song on my uke.</p>
